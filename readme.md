# Sparkline

[Sparklines](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparkline) are tiny line graphs draws inline in the document. They are designed to present the overal trend in data without giving detailed information about a dataset.

## Installation

Sparkline can be installed from bower and npm:

```
npm install sparklines
```
or
```
bower install sparklines
```

## Usage

Sparkline can be used as a commonJS module, AMD module or as a normal script file. It makes the `Sparkline` constructor available, which takes one or two parameters, an inline element and an options object. The contents of the element is replaced with the sparkline.

```JavaScript
var sparkline1 = new Sparkline(document.getElementById("an-inline-element"));
var sparkline2 = new Sparkline($("span")[0], {width: 200});
```

The returned object has a single method, `draw`, which should be called with an array of `Number`s. This method can be called multiple times to redraw the sparkline. 

```JavaScript
sparkline1.draw([1,2,3,4,5]);
sparkline2.draw([0.5,0.5,6,0.5]);
```

## Reference

### Constructor

This is the normal way to create a sparkline instance

### `new Sparkline(HTMLElement, options)`

Returns a sparkline instance. The options object is optional, and overrides the default options if specified. See the section on options further down.

 * `HTMLElement`: An HTMLElement, prefereably an inline element, for example a `<span>`.
 * `options` (optional): An object with custom options for this sparkline instance.

### Static methods

These are helper methods for creating sparkline instances

#### `Sparkline.init(HTMLElement, options)`

Returns a sparkline instance. This work exactly the same as calling the constructor. The options object is optional, and overrides the default options if specified. See the section on options further down.

 * `HTMLElement`: An HTMLElement, prefereably an inline element, for example a `<span>`.
 * `options` (optional): An object with custom options for this sparkline instance.

#### `Sparkline.draw(HTMLElement, values, options)`

Draws the values as a sparkline on the given element, with the specified options, before returning the sparkline instance. This is the same as crating a sparkline instance and then calling `draw(values)`. 

 * `HTMLElement`: An HTMLElement, prefereably an inline element, for example a `<span>`.
 * `values`: An array of numbers to be drawn as a sparkline.
 * `options` (optional): An object with custom options for this sparkline instance.

#### `Sparkline.options`

An object containing the default options for drawing a sparkline. This is shared by all sparkline instances. Change the values of this object before creating sparkline instances. The options (with default values in parenthesis) available are:

 * `width` (`100`): A number giving the width of the sparkline box in pixels.
 * `height` (`null`): A number giving the height of the sparkline box in pixels. By default, uses the height of the Canvas element.
 * `lineColor` (`"black"`): A string giving the color of the sparkline. Any valid CSS color, including RGB, HEX and HSV.
 * `lineWidth` (`1`): A number giving the stroke of the line in pixels.
 * `startColor` (`"transparent"`): A string giving the color of the dot marking the first value. Any valid CSS color.
 * `endColor` (`"red"`): A string giving the color of the dot marking the last value. Any valid CSS color.
 * `maxColor` (`"transparent"`): A string giving the color of the dot marking the highest value. Any valid CSS color.
 * `minColor` (`"transparent"`): A string giving the color of the dot marking the lowest value. Any valid CSS color.
 * `minValue` (`null`): A number giving the minimum y-axis value. By default, the lowest data value is used.
 * `maxValue` (`null`): A number giving the maximum y-axis value. By default, the highest data value is used.
 * `dotRadius` (`2.5`): A number giving the size of the dots used to mark important values.
 * `tooltip` (`null`): A function that takes three arguments (`value`, `index`, `array`) and returns a tooltip string to show when the user hovers over the sparkline. By default there is no tooltip.

### Instance methods

#### `sparkline.draw(values)`

Draws the values as a sparkline in the element given in the constructor. This method can be called multiple times, and will replace the previous sparkline with a new one.

 * `values`: An array of numbers to be drawn as a sparkline
